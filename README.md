# bookshelf-server-ish

For now the bookshelf pages will be built with a simple shell script "someday" it'd be CD'd but why overbuild?

If you want your bookshelf built:

1. Create a repository named `bookshelf` in your GitHub account
2. Put the file `bookshelf.yml` that describes your bookshelf in the repo
3. Open a PR to add your GitHub username to [users](./users)

For an example bookshelf, [see mine](https://github.com/chpwssn/bookshelf).
